    <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p class="size-about">My professional background is primarily that of concierge and administrative work. After working at my first job out of college for 2.5 years with not enough pay and little to no professional growth, I went on to try another job. Every 8 months or so since leaving my first job out of college, I have started a new job. With some instances of having , I felt directionless for several years, and still do, not knowing what I want to do and not having hard skills to set me in a field to pursue. Job hunting is not fun, especially when you do not even know what position title you are looking for, even with general administrative experience. <strong>Hard skills seem to be everything!</strong> I dabbled a little in HTML and CSS before coming to Epicodus. Now, programming is all I can think about. <span style="color:green">I don't do well with online learning so Epicodus seemed to be what I needed!</span></p>
